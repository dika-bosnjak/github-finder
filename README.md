Github Finder App

This App uses Github REST API to retrieve data from Github and provides the functionality to search Github users.

It is developed using React and Tailwind UI created by Hassib Moddasser.

Axios (promise based HTTP client that makes it easy to send asynchronous HTTP requests) is used to fetch data from Github api.
